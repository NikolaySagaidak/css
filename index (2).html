            Hello! My name is Mykola, I am 28 years old. This is my resume business card. I live in Ukraine, I love to travel. I am fond of cycling and extreme sports. Such as motocross, cliff diving, I would also like to learn surfing on the board. That's why I'm currently gaining knowledge in the field of IT. In my opinion, this field of work frees a person from boundaries and borders. And allows a person to be free where he wants.
            For her comfortable life. My path in site programming starts with this site. So far, I've written its simple html structure and added a bit of css to it. In the future, as we learn other languages ​​and frameworks, we would like to create something larger, like an app. I am currently in the process of learning javascript. So in the future it is possible to change this page to something larger. Thank you for visiting my page. Below I added my links to social. network if you suddenly became interested in meeting me. </p></div>
